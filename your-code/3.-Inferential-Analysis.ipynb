    "- Your grandmother says that your sister couldn't play in a professional basketball league (not only the WNBA, but ANY professional basketball league) because she's too skinny and lacks muscle.\n",
    "- Your sister says that most female professional players fail their free throws.\n",
    "- Your brother-in-law heard on the TV that the average assists among NBA (male) and WNBA (female) players is 52 for the 2016-2017 season. He is convinced this average would be higher if we only considered the players from the WNBA.\n",
